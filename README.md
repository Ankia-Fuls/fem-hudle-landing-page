## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- SASS Styling

### What I learned

I learned how to use an SVG as a background image and how to set it's size property to properly rescale according to the width and height of the screen.

I also practiced using aria-label and aria-hidden to make it more accessible.

### Continued development

I would like to continue practicing accessibility as well as play around more with box-shadow designs.

### Useful resources

- [FontAwesome CDN include](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/font-awesome) - This helped me get the CDN include to use the icons for the social media platforms.
- [FontAwesome Icon list](https://fontawesome.com/icons/packs/brands) - This is where I got the includes for the logos.
- [Aria test extention](https://www.ssa.gov/accessibility/andi/help/install.html) - I used this extention to test what screenreaders would read on my webpage to test whether I set the aria contents correctly.
